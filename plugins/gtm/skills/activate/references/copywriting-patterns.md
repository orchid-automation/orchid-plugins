## AIDA Framework

**Attention -- Interest -- Desire -- Action**

The workhorse of B2B marketing copy. Use for landing page sections, email body copy, and one-pagers.

### Structure

| Stage | Goal | Length |
|-------|------|--------|
| **Attention** | Stop the scroll. State a surprising fact, bold claim, or painful truth | 1 sentence |
| **Interest** | Explain why this matters to THEM specifically | 2-3 sentences |
| **Desire** | Show what life looks like after. Use proof points and specifics | 2-4 sentences |
| **Action** | One clear CTA. Remove friction with a risk reducer | 1 sentence |

### B2B SaaS Example: DevOps Monitoring Tool

**Attention:**
> Your on-call engineers got paged 147 times last month. 83 of those were false alarms.

**Interest:**
> Every false alert costs you 23 minutes of engineering time and erodes trust in your monitoring. When the real incident hits at 3am, your team hesitates because they assume it's another false positive.

**Desire:**
> Acme Monitor uses ML-based anomaly detection that learns your system's normal behavior. Teams using it reduce false alerts by 91% in the first 30 days. PagerDuty integrations mean zero workflow changes -- just fewer 3am pages.

**Action:**
> Connect your first data source in 5 minutes. Free for up to 10 services.

### B2B SaaS Example: Sales Engagement Platform

**Attention:**
> Your SDRs spend 68% of their day on tasks that have nothing to do with selling.

**Interest:**
> Between researching prospects, writing emails, logging activities, and switching between 5 tabs, the average rep sends just 43 personalized emails per week. Your competitors' reps send 200.

**Desire:**
> RepFlow automates prospect research, generates personalized sequences from CRM data, and logs everything automatically. Reps using it book 3.2x more meetings without working longer hours. Integrates with Salesforce and HubSpot in one click.

**Action:**
> Start your 14-day free trial. Import your first sequence in under 10 minutes.

## PAS Framework

**Problem -- Agitate -- Solve**

Best for cold emails and landing page hero sections. Works when the ICP has a painful, well-understood problem.

### Structure

| Stage | Goal | Tone |
|-------|------|------|
| **Problem** | Name the specific pain they experience daily | Empathetic |
| **Agitate** | Twist the knife. Show the real cost, the downstream effects, what happens if they do nothing | Urgent |
| **Solve** | Present your product as the relief. Be specific about HOW it solves it | Confident |

### B2B SaaS Example: Data Pipeline Tool

**Problem:**
> Your data team spends Monday mornings fixing broken pipelines instead of building dashboards.

**Agitate:**
> Every pipeline failure means stale data in your exec dashboard, sales reps working from yesterday's numbers, and a data engineer context-switching away from the project your VP asked about last Friday. You've tried adding more tests, but the failures keep coming from upstream schema changes you can't control.

**Solve:**
> DataGuard monitors every upstream schema and alerts your team BEFORE a breaking change hits production. It auto-generates migration scripts for common changes and rolls back the rest. Teams using it cut pipeline failures by 74% in week one.

### B2B SaaS Example: Compliance Automation

**Problem:**
> You're 4 months into SOC 2 prep and your auditor just found 23 more gaps.

**Agitate:**
> Every gap means another sprint diverted from product work. Your engineering team is frustrated. Your sales team can't close enterprise deals without the badge. And the audit firm is billing you $15K/month while you scramble to collect evidence from 12 different tools.

**Solve:**
> CompliBot continuously monitors your infrastructure against SOC 2 controls, auto-collects evidence from AWS, GitHub, and Jira, and generates audit-ready reports. Average time from start to SOC 2 Type II: 6 weeks, not 6 months.

## BAB Framework

**Before -- After -- Bridge**

Best for case study sections, transformation narratives, and one-pager intros. Works when you have concrete before/after metrics.

### Structure

| Stage | Goal | Key element |
|-------|------|------------|
| **Before** | Paint the current painful state. Use the prospect's language | Specificity |
| **After** | Show the desired future state. Use metrics if possible | Contrast |
| **Bridge** | Your product is how they get from Before to After | Brevity |

### B2B SaaS Example: Customer Support Tool

**Before:**
> Your support team handles 200 tickets/day. Average response time: 4 hours. CSAT: 3.2/5. Three agents just quit because they're burned out answering the same 15 questions over and over.

**After:**
> 60% of tickets auto-resolved before a human sees them. Response time: 11 minutes. CSAT: 4.7/5. Your agents handle escalations that actually need human judgment -- and they stay.

**Bridge:**
> HelpBot uses your existing knowledge base to answer common questions instantly, routes complex issues to the right specialist, and learns from every resolved ticket. Deploys on your existing Zendesk in 30 minutes.

### B2B SaaS Example: Recruiting Platform

**Before:**
> Your hiring pipeline: 500 resumes per role, 2 weeks to screen, 45 days to fill. Your best candidates accept other offers while you're still scheduling interviews.

**After:**
> AI-ranked candidates in your inbox every morning. Time-to-screen: 2 hours. Time-to-fill: 18 days. Offer acceptance rate up 40% because you move faster than every other company they're talking to.

**Bridge:**
> TalentMatch scores candidates against your actual hiring criteria (not keyword matching), auto-schedules interviews based on team availability, and sends personalized updates so candidates never ghost you.

## 4U Formula

**Useful -- Urgent -- Unique -- Ultra-specific**

Best for headlines, email subject lines, and CTA buttons. Score each element 1-4 and aim for 12+.

### Scoring

| Element | Score 1 (weak) | Score 4 (strong) |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Useful** | "Improve your process" | "Cut onboarding time by 60%" |
| **Urgent** | No time pressure | "Before your next board meeting" |
| **Unique** | Generic claim | "The only tool that does X without Y" |
| **Ultra-specific** | "Save money" | "Save $47K/year on manual data entry" |

### Examples

**Weak (score: 6/16):**
> Improve your team's productivity with our solution

**Strong (score: 14/16):**
> Cut your SDR team's admin time from 4 hours/day to 23 minutes -- before Q3 pipeline review

**Weak (score: 5/16):**
> Better analytics for your business

**Strong (score: 15/16):**
> The only pipeline dashboard that predicts missed quota 3 weeks before month-end -- no data team needed

## Feature to Benefit to Proof Conversion

Every product feature must be converted through this chain before it appears in any marketing asset.

### The Chain

```
Feature (what it does)
  → Benefit (why the buyer cares)
    → Proof (why they should believe you)
```

### Conversion Template

| Feature | So what? | Benefit | Prove it | Proof |
|---------|----------|---------|----------|-------|
| AI-powered lead scoring | Reps focus on leads that close | 3x more meetings from the same list | How do you know? | "Acme Corp booked 340% more demos in month one" |
| Real-time sync with Salesforce | No manual data entry | Reps save 4 hours/week | How do you know? | "Average rep reclaims 11 minutes per prospect" |
| One-click deployment | No DevOps needed to launch | Go live in 5 minutes, not 5 sprints | How do you know? | "Median deploy time: 4 min 22 sec across 1,200 customers" |

### Rules

1. **Never put a feature in marketing copy without the benefit.** "AI-powered" means nothing. "Scores leads so your reps only call buyers who are ready" means everything.
2. **Never state a benefit without proof.** "Save time" is a claim. "Save 4 hours/week based on data from 500 teams" is evidence.
3. **Use the persona's language for the benefit.** If the buyer says "I waste time on data entry," the benefit is "No more data entry." Not "streamlined data workflows."

### Where to Find Proof Points

- `01-scan.md`: capability counts, integration counts, technical complexity
- `02-market.md`: competitor pricing (for cost comparison), market sizing (for opportunity framing)
- `03-position.md`: battle card proof points, messaging pillar evidence

## Choosing the Right Framework

| Asset | Primary Framework | Secondary |
|-------|------------------|-----------|
| Landing page hero | PAS or BAB | 4U for headline |
| Landing page features | Feature → Benefit → Proof | -- |
| Landing page FAQ | Direct answer (no framework) | -- |
| Cold email (touch 1-2) | AIDA | PAS for opener |
| Cold email (touch 3-5) | PAS | BAB for case study angle |
| One-pager intro | BAB | AIDA for structure |
| One-pager body | Feature → Benefit → Proof | -- |
| Objection handler | Direct answer + proof | -- |
| ROI calculator copy | BAB for intro | 4U for headline |
| Subject lines | 4U | PAS (short form) |
