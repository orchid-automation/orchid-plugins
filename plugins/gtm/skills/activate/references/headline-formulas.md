## Usage Guide

**For landing page hero:** Use formulas 6, 7, 8, or 9 (outcome-focused). The hero must promise a result.

**For landing page subheadline:** Use formulas 1 or 2 (problem-focused). Pair an outcome headline with a problem subheadline.

**For email subject lines:** Use formulas 14, 15, or 17 (questions/stats). Subject lines should provoke curiosity. Keep under 50 characters.

**For one-pager headline:** Use formulas 6 or 10 (transformation/replacement). One-pagers need to communicate value in one glance.

**For CTA buttons:** Not headlines -- but apply formula 9's brevity: "[Action] in [time]. [Risk reducer]." Example: "Start free -- deploy in 5 minutes."

**Scoring rule:** Before using any headline, score it with the 4U formula from copywriting-patterns.md. Aim for 12+ out of 16.
